<summary> Daily type note</summary>
<br>
Long term goal / Long term task section. Because the daily type note serves as a daily hub for me, it is convenient to display important things which I have coming up in a way which feels more readable and concise than a calendar.

When it is easier to plan habits and organize habits, it is easier to develop and maintain these habits. The nodes reset weekly. By clicking one of the black rectangles on the left side, a node on the right side will be created, indicating that I intend to do it over the course of the day.

I think it is good to read everyday. I usually read a few books at a time, so this section is a good way to indicate and commit to reading part of a book over the course of the day. A book can be selected by pushing the middle button and is indicated by the gray outline. The purple button on the left can be used to directly open the corresponding reading type note associated with the book.

This section is for creating daily tasks and then reacting to them. Tasks are generated in the top section and once they are completed are moved down to the bottom section, where a collapsable text area is generated for reactions and reflections. The flexibility of this section is particularly valuable when compared to daily planning on paper.

The text sections at the bottom are used for daily thoughts and ideas. The section on the left is intended for thoughts at the beginning of the day and the right section is for thoughts at the end of the day.

The two large buttons at the top are used to expand either the left or right section. This feature is particularly useful for expanding the text sections when writing them. It also allows the expansion of the book section for choosing the 3 books for the compact section. It creates three lists out of all of the book notes contained in the app. The three sections are intended to resemble bookshelves.

<summary> Reading type note</summary>
<br>

The motivation for creating the reading type note was due to a disliking for the conventional design decisions made by notetaking apps.
Notetaking apps tend to value flexibility. However, I prefer a pre-determined format for notetaking because it easier to not have to worry about organizing the notes
in a readable way for later reference. With the convention of excerpt from the text on the left and reaction to the excerpt on the right, I know exactly what I am
looking at. The benefit of a rigid structure is shown below by how I would take notes in my philosophy class using a normal vs. my notetaking app.

The five types of separators provide enough flexibility to create a sufficient amount of structure but not enough flexibility that it is overwhelming and distracting.

Conventional notetaking and document editing apps tend to create functionality to mimic how people take notes on paper. But why would we want to take notes on computers
like we take notes on paper? ðŸ‘Ž Below is an example of how a traditional bullet point notetaking style can be translated into my app but in a way which is more readable.

Notetaking apps mimic paper unnecessarily in the way that a large amount of text takes up a disproportionate amount of space compared to its position in the hierarchy.
