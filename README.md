Reading type note

The motivation for creating the reading type note was due to a disliking for the conventional design decisions made by notetaking apps.
Notetaking apps tend to value flexibility. However, I prefer a pre-determined format for notetaking because it easier to not have to worry about organizing the notes
in a readable way for later reference. With the convention of excerpt from the text on the left and reaction to the excerpt on the right, I know exactly what I am
looking at. The benefit of a rigid structure is shown below by how I would take notes in my philosophy class using a normal vs. my notetaking app.

The five types of separators provide enough flexibility to create a sufficient amount of structure but not enough flexibility that it is overwhelming and distracting.

Conventional notetaking and document editing apps tend to create functionality to mimic how people take notes on paper. But why would we want to take notes on computers
like we take notes on paper? ðŸ‘Ž Below is an example of how a traditional bullet point notetaking style can be translated into my app but in a way which is more readable.

Notetaking apps mimic paper unnecessarily in the way that a large amount of text takes up a disproportionate amount of space compared to its position in the hierarchy.
